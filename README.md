#Visual Illusions in CSS3

As an experiment to push my ways of thinking about what is and isn't possible with CSS3 I decided to create a number of famous visual illusions using exclusively CSS.

These include:

- [The Illusory Contoured Tilting Pyramid] by Pietro Guardani & Luciano Gamberini from the University of Padova
- [The Mutually Interfering Shapes Illusion] by Maarten Wijntjes, Robert Volcic & Tomas Knapen from Utrecht University
- [Lucy in the Sky] by Arthur Shapiro & Justin Charles
